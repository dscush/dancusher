Go ahead and <a href=\"http://www.friendsgpl.org\">check it out</a> for yourself, or dig into the <a href=\"http://www.github.com/dscush/friends-public\">source code</a>.  I especially like how various links, especially on the About page, send you to the Contact page with the form partially prepopulated for you.  That took a while, but I learned <i>a lot</i> about Angular UI-Router."

I certainly wouldn't call it AI or Artificial Creativity, but I'm hoping it might serve as a fun tool to aid musicians in accessing their own creativity.  It's very early in development and it's only available so far as a module, but if you know basic Python you should be able to figure it out from the <a href=\"http://www.github.com/dscush/rcpg\">source code</a>.  I'm still unsure if this will even generate any interesting output at all, but I'm hopeful.  If it does, I'll A) submit it to PyPI for other developers and B) wrap it in a web app for end users to enter their own PMFs.  This is my first time creating something from the beginning using <strong>test driven development</strong>.  The idea was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7a1Ua6kvcA\">Langorhythm</a>"

When I became Membership Chair, I was given a single over-complicated Excel sheet with rows organized by both individual and family.  First I split that out into a relational database (a table for individuals and a table for families), but when I realized that eventually there would be a new Membership Chair who didn't know <strong>SQL</strong>, I decided to wrap it in Django's beautiful built-in admin app.  I plan to incorporate this into the main Friends site as a backend, so that I can A) store other site data there and B) allow board members to login and view the membership info via that same site.
